I'm a **Postdoctoral Research Associate** at [Northeastern University](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/), working in the [Rad Lab](https://eliassi.org/radlab.html) and [Network Science Institute (NetSI)](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/). My research sits at the intersection of **machine learning**, **network science**, and **human behavior**.

### 🔬 Research Themes

* 🧠 **Veracity in Large Language Models (LLMs)**: understanding how models encode factual inforamtion.
* 🌐 **Networked Intelligence**: modeling belief diffusion and collective reasoning in interconnected AI-human systems.
* ⚖️ **Interpretability**: building transparent, trustworthy ML tools for behavioral and social data.
* 💡 **Modeling Trajectories with LLMs**

### 🧩 Featured Projects

* **[Trilemma of Truth](https://github.com/carlomarxdk/trilemma-of-truth)** — dataset and analysis framework exploring true / false / neither factual statements in LLMs.
* **[sAwMIL](https://github.com/carlomarxdk/sawmil) (Sparse-Aware Multiple Instance Learning)** — a probing classifier for layer-wise interpretability.
* **[LIFE2VEC](https://github.com/SocialComplexityLab/life2vec) / [life2vec-light](https://github.com/carlomarxdk/life2vec-light)** — transformer model for life-course prediction using population-scale registry data (developed during my PhD).
